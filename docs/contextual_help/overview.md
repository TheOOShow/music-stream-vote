# Overview #

**Music Stream Vote** collects and displays votes for the track currently playing on your IceCast music radio station. Use this settings screen to change the WordPress plugin's and IRC bot's settings.

If you change a setting that requires restarting the bot, then the bot will be automatically restarted (if you are running it on the same host as WordPress). You can't start the bot from within WordPress if it's not already running. See [Full Documentation](README.md) for more details.

To change a setting back to its default, clear it out and save.
