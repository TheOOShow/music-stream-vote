UNFINISHED! Collects and displays votes for the track currently playing on your IceCast music radio station. Votes are collected via a bot in your station's IRC channel. Current stats can be shown in WordPress or in IRC.

== Description ==

When complete, this plugin will host a voting backend to collect votes for what is now playing on an IceCast Internet radio station. Votes will be collected via an embedded IRC bot in the ./bot folder of the plugin (not implemented yet) and stored in custom MySQL tables in the WordPress installation's MySQL database.

It is assumed that most interaction between the radio station and the users happens in an IRC channel, so this is where voting will happen. (We may add the ability to vote via the WordPress site as well, but for now we are focusing on IRC's authentication and abuse-prevention mechanisms to keep it simple.) The IRC bot will be fairly dumb, only relaying vote request and responses to the WordPress backend and allowing "current top ten" queries. The IRC bot will also take the task of polling the IceCast stream's XML status file to create "new track start" events.

WordPress widgets and shortcodes will be provided to display current top n lists like "most played", "highest voted", etc.

== Implemented so far ==

* MySQL table structure is stuck on the lead developer's machine; needs to be ported over into an install/upgrade script in the plugin's source code.
* JSON-based web service to accept and post "new track start" and "vote" events.
* Bare-bones test script to submit events to the web service.
* Start of an admin screen.

== To do ==

* Implement the IRC bot in ./bot using the PHP-IRC framework (so that we're not branching out to a different language).
* Add live statistics updates to handlers for "new track start" and "vote" events, so that queries for current tallies can be quick and non-resource-intensive. (Optimize for at most ~100 users in IRC chat room).
* Create WordPress display code for widgets or shortcodes to display vote/play tallies.
* Add all settings and look-and-feel strings to plugin admin screen, to be fed to the IRC bot on demand. The site admin should be able to handle everything from WordPress, without fiddling with the bot's config files.
